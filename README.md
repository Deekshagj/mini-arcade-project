Welcome to the Mini Arcade Project! This project implements a mini-arcade where users can play fun games all in one destination. The project was developed using Python and utilizes Tkinter, a Python GUI library, as the interface.

## Games Included

### 1. Rock, Paper, Scissors

A classic game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the choices made.
